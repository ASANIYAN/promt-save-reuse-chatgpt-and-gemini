# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to our project! Weâ€™re excited to have you here. Please read through the following guidelines to help you understand how to interact with our community and contribute effectively.

## How to Contribute

- Make sure your code follows our coding standards. We recommend using consistent formatting and naming conventions.
- Test your code thoroughly before submitting a pull request to ensure that it does not introduce new bugs.
- Include comments in your code to explain complex logic or assumptions.
- Check the [issues page](https://github.com/atj393/promt-save-reuse-chatgpt-and-gemini/issues) for `good-first-issue` and `hacktoberfest` labels. These are beginner-friendly and great for new contributors.

## Coding Standards

- Use meaningful variable names that explain their purpose.
- Ensure functions and methods are self-explanatory.
- Avoid using hardcoded values. Use constants or configuration files where necessary.
- Follow JavaScript ES6+ conventions and make use of arrow functions, `const` and `let` for variable declarations.
